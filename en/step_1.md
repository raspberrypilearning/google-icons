Google Material Icons are a set of customisable, vector icons designed and maintained by Google. They are widely used in web and mobile app development to make the visual appeal of user interfaces better.

Open [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/icons){:target="_blank"}. The link will open in a new tab.
